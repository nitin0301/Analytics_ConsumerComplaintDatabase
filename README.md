# Analytics_ConsumerComplaintDatabase

This project is based on the dataset obtained from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (CFPB) Consumer Complaint Database. The data is directly downloaded from the "Download the data" section of their [website](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/).

NOTE: The complaints database came live from July 2011. Hence, year 2011 will not be considered for plotting any Yearly trend.
